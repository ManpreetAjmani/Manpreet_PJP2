# Week-2
1. Build a Date-Time Calculator, with menu options; Inputs to be taken from
the console and output to be displayed to the console;

- Add, Subtract between two dates and express the output in days, dates,
weeks, months; (Involves String to Dates conversion);
- Add, Subtract 'n' Days, Months, Weeks to the given date and derive the final

date
- Determine the Day of the Week for a given date

- Determine the Week number for a given a date

- Translate natural language phrases like "Today, Tomorrow, Day-aftertomorrow, yesterday, Day-before-yesterday, Last week, Previous week, Next
week, Next month, Next Year, Last month, Last year, Month after, Month
before, n weeks from now, n days from now, n months from now, n years
from now, n days earlier, n weeks earlier, n months earlier, n years earlier
etc."

2. Extend the Date-Time Calculator to capture and display history of the
calculations in the session in Memory

3. Extend the Date-Time Calculator to support multiple languages (Ex: English,
Hindi, French etc.)

4. Extend the Date-Time Calculator to capture, persist (file storage) and
display history for the last 100 sessions (the display needs to be paused &
continued) - Using Serialization, Custom Data Structures & text, binary File
formats, CSV, XML, YAML, JSON

5. Extend the Date-Time Calculator to support bulk processing & operations -
A file of 100,000 operations;

6. Convert the OOPS based design to Functional programming using lambdas

7. Automate the data-creation part of generating the file with 100,000
operations

* Apply/Practice TDD, BDD while doing the assignment; Outputs should
include unit test report;
